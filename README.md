# Code_Challenge
write a script that takes a keyword as an argument from the command line.  
The script would then search Google and Bing for the keyword.   
The script will visit the top 6 search results from both Google and Bing.   
On each visited page from the search results list, scrape the <title> element.  
Store the url for the visited page and the contents of the <title> element in a CSV file.   
In the end there should be two CSV files output:  one for the Google results and one for Bing.
